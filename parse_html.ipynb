      "Course Overview and Prerequisites This course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with an understanding of how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. There are no course prerequisites.

Learning Outcomes Create and use pandas DataFrames to represent raw data Extract information from text data using regular expressions Understand high level patterns of data cleaning and how they are realized in python Understand how other formats embed semantics in data and how one can approach representing them in tabular formats Understand the issues of replication in data science and how it starts with data manipulation Have an awareness of other kinds of structured data such as networks, graphs, natural language Grading Course Assignment Percentage of Final Grade Week 1 Jupyter Notebook Assignments, part 1, 2, and 3 25% (total) Week 2 Jupyter Notebook Assignment, part 1, 2, and 3 25% (total) Week 3 Jupyter Notebook Assignment 25% Week 4 Jupyter Notebook Assignment 25% All assignments can be resubmitted as many times as you like up until the assignment deadline with the best submission counting towards your grade.
