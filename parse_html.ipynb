Letter Grades, Course Grades, and Late Submission Policy We realize that the occasional crisis might mess up your schedule enough to require a bit of extra time in completing a course assignment. Thus, we have instituted the following late policy that gives you a limited number of flexible “late day” credits. You have three (3) free late days to use during SIADS 515. One late day equals exactly one 24-hour period after the due date of the assignment (including weekends). No fractional late days: they are all or nothing. Once you have used up your late days, 25% penalty for each subsequent 24-hour period after the deadline that an assignment is late. For example, if the due date is 11:59pm Sunday, with no late days left, penalties would be: Before 11:59pm Monday: 25% deduction Before 11:59pm Tuesday: 50% deduction Before 11:59pm Wednesday: 75% deduction After 11:59pm Thursday: 100% deduction You don't need to explain or get permission to use late days, and we will track them for you. Note that resubmissions after the deadline will be counted as late submissions. The grading scale for this course is as follows: A 95% A- 90% B+ 87% B 83% B- 80% C+ 77% C 73% C- 70% D+ 67% D 63% D- 60% F 0% Academic Integrity/Code of Conduct Refer to the Academic and Professional Integrity section of the UMSI Student Handbook.
